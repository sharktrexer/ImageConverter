### Convert Images

Currently only converts all ".jpg" or ".png" files in its directory into black and white and halves their size. Will include more functionality later.
For now is a test ground of experimenting with Python Pillow package. 
Also showcases my improvement in programming skill, the original code is commented out to be compared to.

### Instructions
1. To run you need to download python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads)
2. Also must install Pillow using the command "python -m pip install Pillow"
3. Download _ImageConverter.py_ and place in an approriate folder (**Make sure it is in a separate folder, it will search for ALL .jpgs and .pngs in its directory**).
4. Place any png or jpg images you would like to convert in the same folder as the .py file.
5. Open a command prompt and change to the directory to wherever the file is located.
6. Enter "python ImageConverter.py" to run.
